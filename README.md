<p>
    Summarizer is a BetterDiscord plugin that generates summaries of articles linked in Discord messages. It uses AI-powered summarization to provide concise and informative summaries, making it easier for users to quickly grasp the main points of shared articles without having to read through the entire content.

## Configuration

To use the Summarizer plugin, you need to provide an API key for the AI provider. Follow these steps to configure the plugin:

1. Go to User Settings > Plugins.
2. In the settings panel, enter your API key for the selected AI provider (e.g., Google Gemini).
3. Choose the desired AI model from the dropdown list (default is "gemini-1.5-flash").

## Usage

Once the Summarizer plugin is installed and configured, it will automatically detect article links in Discord messages. When a message contains a link, you will see a "âœ¨ Summarize" button in the message context menu (right-click on the message).

Click on the "âœ¨ Summarize" button to generate a summary of the linked article. The summary will be appended to the original message, formatted as follows:

```

> **ðŸŒŸ Key Highlights**
> 1. {{keyPoints1}}.

> - {{mainTopicsN}}
> **ðŸ’¡ Takeaway**
