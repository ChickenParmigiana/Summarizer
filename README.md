3. Navigate to your BetterDiscord plugins folder. You can find this folder by going to User Settings > Plugins > Open Plugin Folder within Discord.
4. Drag and drop the `Summarizer.plugin.js` file into the plugins folder.
5. Enable the Summarizer plugin from the BetterDiscord plugins tab.

## Configuration

To use the Summarizer plugin, you need to provide an API key for the AI provider. Follow these steps to configure the plugin:

1. Go to User Settings > Plugins.
2. In the settings panel, enter your API key for the selected AI provider (e.g., Google Gemini).
3. Choose the desired AI model from the dropdown list (default is "gemini-1.5-flash").
4. Edit the system prompt, summary template and output template to your liking.

## Usage

Once the Summarizer plugin is installed and configured, it will automatically detect article links in Discord messages. When a message contains a link, you will see a "âœ¨ Summarize" button in the message context menu (right-click on the message).

Click on the "âœ¨ Summarize" button to generate a summary of the linked article. The message will be edited to include the summary using your template.

### Default template
